# Bike Share Data Exploration in R
This project explores **bike share systems** in three major U.S. cities: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**.  
Using **R**, we analyze usage patterns by computing descriptive statistics and creating data visualizations.
## Project Structure
- `Jupyter Notebook/`: Contains an **.ipynb** version of the project for use with R kernel in Jupyter.
- `R Studio/`: Contains a **.r** script and a **.Rproj** file for use in RStudio.
- Both folders include the same datasets.

## How to Run

### Option 1: In RStudio
1. Open the `R Studio.Rproj` file or load `explore_bikeshare_data.R`.
2. Run the script step by step.
3. Ensure your working directory is set to the folder containing the data.

### Option 2: In Jupyter
1. Use a Jupyter environment with R kernel installed.
2. Open `Explore_bikeshare_data.ipynb`.
3. Run the cells in order.

## Requirements

- R (4.0+)
- Package: ggplot2
